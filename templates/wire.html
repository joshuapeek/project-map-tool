      <p>This KNOWN ISSUE was resolved by running two queries: one for project
        roles already listed in ROLESCREEN table for this screen,
        and one for those roles who do not have an entry in this screen in
        ROLESCREEN. Both are then written into the table.</p>

      <h3>Sections</h3>
      <p>Sections will appear here as colored "boxes". Title/description will
        appear at top of each box, with an edit and delete button. Cards
        will appear within for each defined "element" that will appear in the
        section. Cards will contain edit button, allowing adjustment of
        title/description as well as a delete element button. Similar to
        "Project" page's Roles/Screens, a 'ghost' card will also exist,
        allowing addition of new elements within the section.</p>
        <p>Below the last section, a button will appear, allowing the addition
          of a new section. Will need to give some thought to allowing
          user to reorder the sections, as likely this will become a ux issue.<p>
